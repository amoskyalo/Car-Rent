Welcome to the Car Rental App repository! This is a mobile application built using React Native, Sanity.io, and Socket.io. The app allows users to browse and rent cars, chat with other users and car renters, and explore various settings and search options.

## Features

  1. Car browsing: Users can browse through a wide selection of cars available for rent. They can view details about each car, such as its make, model, year, price, and availability.

  2. Chat functionality: The app provides an in-app chat feature, allowing users to communicate with other people or car renters. Users can exchange messages, negotiate rental terms, and get any additional information they need.

  3. New user notifications: Users are notified when a new user joins the app. They can initiate a chat with the newcomer, ask questions, or offer assistance.

  4. Settings: The app offers a settings page where users can configure their preferences, update their profile information, and manage notification settings.

  5. Car search: Users can easily search for specific cars based on their preferences. They can filter results by make, model, year, price range, and other relevant criteria.

## Technologies Used

  1. React Native: A popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React.

  2. Sanity.io: A headless CMS (Content Management System) that provides a structured backend for managing car listings and related content.

  3. Socket.io: A real-time communication library that enables instant messaging and notifications between app users.
